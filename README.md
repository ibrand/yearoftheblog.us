# yearoftheblog.us
Year of The Blog Directory Site

To add yourself or (someone) to the directory, add your rss feed link as the key and the name you'd like to be seen as to the value to the config object.

## TODO
- Fix the mobile scroll
- Remove the click animation on the ring
- Try moving the RSS links to RSS instead of atom
- Fix the spinner animation so it's not jumpy
- Maybe make a roundup newsletter weekly that people can subscribe to that sends all of the blogs that updated that week
